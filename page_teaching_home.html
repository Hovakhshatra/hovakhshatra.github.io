        This page help you to find some teaching, exams, exercises, interviews etc that I designed so far. There are so many files, so it will take a long time to organize them here. But in any case I hope you use this to improve your backgrounds, specially if you are determined to join my team in a near future.

        <h1>Classes that I taught/teach</h1>

        <h2>Advanced Algorithms</h2>

        <p>I am currently teaching this class, September - December 2024 at Coventry University for 2nd year Bachelor students at Computer Science, Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Software Engineer. I am the module leader and teach the lecture session which are on Fridays 9:00-11:00, I also design and update the materials both for the lecture sessions and for the lab sessions, but a colleague will do the lab sessions. I design the exam and the model answers and the marking guide, but a PhD student will do the marking afterwards. We started with a lab session indexed 0 which its aim is to recall the basic coding skills of the students from their year 1. Then we have lecture session with exercises and reading tasks for the student to complete until the lab session which is one day before the next lecture session. You can see the files by clicking on the relevant item below. I will not put the exam or the assessed asignments here at least until 1 year after the end of the course. So for those files come back next year ^_^ I also won't share materials created by others or with their help.</p>

        <p>Go through these files in order and do not look at the file of answers before you finished all of the lab questions file and you really give all you can for solving them. Don't sit 1 minute looking at your phone screen and then say "ah, this exercise is hard, let's look at its answer!"</p>
