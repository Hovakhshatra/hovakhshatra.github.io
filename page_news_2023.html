            <p style="display: inline;">Tereso del Rio's new paper is published. The title of the paper is "<i>Clustering in the Lazard method for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition</i>". It is an extended abstract for a poster submission at <a href = "https://www.issac-conference.org/2023/">ISSAC 2023</a> which also brought the <a href = "https://www.issac-conference.org/2023/awards.php">distinguished poster award</a> to Tereso at this conference. This is now published at <a href = "https://dl.acm.org/newsletter/sigsam-cca">ACM Communications in Computer Algebra</a>. The link to access this paper is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3637529.3637533">https://doi.org/10.1145/3637529.3637533</a>.</p>

            <p style="display: inline;">I am invited to give a seminar (remotely) in an event hosted by <a href = "https://www.jahromu.ac.ir/fa">Jahrom University</a> for the week of research on Sunday 24th at 7:30 a.m. UK time (11:00 a.m. Iran time). The event is an in person event, therefore there is no link to share with those who wants to join online. The language of the event is also in Persian. I will share the link to the news and poster as soon as they share it with me. In case you are interested, Jahrom is a city with rich history, you can check its Wikipedia page. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahrom">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahrom</a></p>

            <p style="display: inline;">My proposal for a funded Master by Research (MRes) is approved. This is a <a href = "https://www.britishcouncil.org/study-work-abroad/in-uk/scholarship-women-stem" >British Council Women in STEM</a> MRes scholarship. Any female student from one of the following countries Pakistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lank and Bangladish can apply for this position. It will be 1 year program, fully funded. And in case the student is doing very good and above the expectation, the MRes can be converted to a PhD with just adding 2 additional years (again fully funded). I will put the link to the advertisement as soon as it became available. The students need to apply through the Coventry University ad and go through the standard process of CV, cover letter etc and then in case of being shortlisted, having formal interview.</p>

            <p style="display: inline;">My proposal for a Summer Research Internship Opportunities is accepted. That means a master student can work as an intern on one of my projects for 3 months and the university will provide him/her with accommodation in the halls of residence in the centre of Coventry and on campus for the duration of the internship. In addition, he will receive a bursary of Â£150 per week. However, note that this is an internal call, therefore only students of Coventry University can apply. I must say that I won't accept any student! Only a student with good knowledge of coding and willingness to a real hardworking would be accepted. I prefer to not pick up any intern rather than having someone who can't or doesn't want to do his tasks ^_^ If you are interested or know an interested candidate, please share the following link with them (again, it is an internal link, so not everyone can see its content). <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flivecoventryac.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2Fstaff-and-students-CentreforResearchCapabilityAndDevelopment%2FSitePages%2FSummer-research-Internship-Scheme.aspx&data=05%7C01%7Cad6397%40coventry.ac.uk%7Ca7a5f33b189448c8472e08db05d45d7d%7C4b18ab9a37654abeac7c0e0d398afd4f%7C0%7C0%7C638110181874311056%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=SadepFEJaYnW%2F8j7CHjttz1nEfMhQExaRI%2FL473gS8Q%3D&reserved=0">Link to the Summer Research Internship Scheme 2023</a>.</p>

            <p style="display: inline;">I gave a seminar at the math department of Chulalongkorn university (the 1st ranked university in Thailand) on 18th of January 2023. You can find the poster, the recorded video and the group photo of the talk at the facebook page of their math department (click <a href="https://www.facebook.com/math.cu.seminar/posts/pfbid02yk92KPrpBQDUh2WHD8NVGj6PaMFc4AjBMgthrHhVxN6rsC88DAJzeHBvLnRHbUCcl">here</a>, <a href="https://fb.watch/ioOV6pC6jv/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/math.cu.seminar/posts/pfbid038wKdp3v8AZAjDSYbirEygTK5qXWE8S1EVgtc9UnotMeHwLTLPb6cYn56RKrMb7yl">here</a> for the poster, video and the photo respectively). It seems the audio and the video are not synced. Also note that there is a typo in the slide number 3, the length of edges of the squares should be 40, 80 and 10 not 400, 800, 100 and in the formula in the English text, the denominator should be 1600 not 16.</p>
